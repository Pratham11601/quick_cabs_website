In the Middle Ages, it rose as a religious and intellectual hub. Paris flourished during the Renaissance and became the epicenter of revolutionary ideas during the French Revolution in 1789. The 19th century saw its transformation with Napoleon and Baron Haussmann's redesign, introducing wide boulevards and parks.
